      <h2>Trees</h2>
      <p> Trees are typically large, woody plants with a single main stem or trunk and branches that support leaves.
        They play
        a vital role in providing oxygen, shade, and habitat for various species. Examples include oak, pine, and maple
        trees.

        <h2>Flowers</h2>
        <p> Flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants. They come in a wide range of colors,
          shapes, and sizes. Flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies and are essential for plant
          reproduction.

          <h2>Shrubs</h2>
          <p> Shrubs are smaller than trees but larger than herbaceous plants. They have woody stems and can be
            evergreen or deciduous. Shrubs are often used in landscaping and garden design. Examples include lilac,
            azalea, and boxwood.

          <header>
            <h2>Grasses</h2>
            <p> Grasses are herbaceous plants with slender, elongated leaves. They are important for lawns,
              pastures,
              and as food sources for herbivores. Examples include Kentucky bluegrass, wheat, and bamboo.

            <header>
              <h2>Ferns</h2>
              <p> Ferns are non-flowering, vascular plants that reproduce via spores. They are known for their
                feathery,
                often intricate fronds. Ferns thrive in shady, moist environments. Examples include the Boston fern and
                maidenhair
                fern.

                <h2>Cacti and Succulents</h2>
                <p> Cacti and succulents are adapted to arid conditions and store water in their
                  fleshy
                  stems
                  or leaves. They come in various shapes and sizes, often with unique adaptations for water
                  conservation.
                  Examples
                  include the saguaro cactus and aloe vera.

                  <h2>Vines</h2>
                  <p> Vines are plants that climb or sprawl along other structures for support. They are often
                    used
                    for
                    ornamental purposes or to cover fences and walls. Examples include ivy, grapevines, and wisteria.

                      They
                      have
                      adaptations to survive in waterlogged conditions. Examples include water lilies, lotus, and
                      duckweed.

                      <h2>Mosses and Liverworts</h2>
                      <p> Mosses and liverworts are non-vascular, small, primitive plants that
                        thrive
                        in
                        moist
                        environments. They form lush carpets in shaded areas. Examples include sphagnum moss and
                        Marchantia
                        liverwort.

                        <h2>Algae</h2>
                        <p>Algae are simple, photosynthetic organisms that can be found in aquatic
                          environments.
                          They
                          vary

                          size
                          and shape, from microscopic single-celled forms to large seaweeds. Examples include green
                          algae,
                          brown
